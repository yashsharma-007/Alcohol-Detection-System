## Overview  
This project is a **smart alcohol detection system** designed to enhance road safety by detecting alcohol levels in a driver. The system is equipped with sensors to detect alcohol concentration, automatically stop the vehicle by controlling the motor, and send an alert SMS with the driver's GPS location to a predefined phone number.  

This solution aims to prevent drunk driving accidents by integrating hardware components like GSM, GPS, and alcohol sensors with software logic.

## Features  
- **Alcohol Detection**: Uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to monitor alcohol levels.  
- **Automatic Vehicle Stopping**: Controls the motor to stop the car immediately when alcohol is detected.  
- **Alert System**: Activates a buzzer and sends an SMS with the GPS location of the vehicle in case of detection.  
- **Failsafe Design**: The vehicle remains stopped until alcohol levels drop below the threshold.

## Working Principle  
1. **Initialization**:  
   - The system initializes the GSM and GPS modules and sends an SMS indicating that the system is ready.  

2. **Alcohol Detection**:  
   - The MQ-3 sensor continuously monitors the alcohol level in the driver's vicinity.
   - The sensor output is averaged over multiple samples to ensure accuracy.  

3. **Vehicle Stopping Mechanism**:  
   - If the alcohol level exceeds the predefined threshold:
     - The relay module immediately disconnects the motor from the power supply, stopping the vehicle.  
     - A buzzer is activated to provide an audible alert.  

4. **Alert Mechanism**:  
   - Along with stopping the vehicle, an SMS is sent to a predefined phone number containing a warning and the GPS location of the vehicle.  

5. **Failsafe Reset**:  
   - The system resets when alcohol levels drop below the threshold, allowing the motor to start again.

## Installation and Setup  
### **Hardware Setup**  
1. Connect the MQ-3 alcohol sensor to the analog pin `A0` of the Arduino.  
2. Connect the GSM module's TX and RX pins to pins `6` and `7` of the Arduino, respectively.  
3. Connect the GPS module's TX and RX pins to pins `10` and `11` of the Arduino, respectively.  
4. Wire the relay module to pin `9` and connect it to control the motor power supply.  
5. Connect the buzzer to pin `8` of the Arduino.  
6. Power all components using a suitable 5V DC power supply.  

### **Software Setup**  
1. Install the required Arduino libraries:
   - `TinyGPS++`
   - `SoftwareSerial` (comes pre-installed).  
2. Replace the placeholder phone number (`+91 YOUR NUMBER`) in the code with your actual phone number.  
3. Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
